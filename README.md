# ID3-tags-changer

Read the code to get its use. Its still in inintal stages so no instrections are there at the moment.

To use, run 'pip install -r requirements.txt' and start Song_Tag_Changer.py.

I have not tested this on linux, but there may be issue with file paths in any linux distro. if you find any issue, please open an issue on github. I will try to fix it
